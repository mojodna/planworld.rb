Facebook Featureset
- single wiki-style textarea ("plan")
- snitch (always on or opt-in?  i think opt-in doesn't have a place here because there are existing ways to communicate w/o this dynamic)
- snoop (?  with optional message notifications)
- private to networks (later can specify which networks)
- implicit planwatch using friends (can be expanded later)
