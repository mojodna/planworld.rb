CrudGenerator
=============

A combination of a base controller class, and a generator. You use the CRUDController as the base class for your controllers (e.g. BooksController < CRUDController). You use the generators to generate the models / controllers, much like the scaffold generator and scaffold_resource generator. The views that get generated all follow the syntax of the new RESTful features built into Rails, and the conventions used by the SimplyHelpful plugin.

You don't have to move code anywhere, the CRUDController and helper hook themselves in automatically.

INSTRUCTIONS
===============

Generates a CRUD-ready controller and model.

Example:

  script/generate crud book

Will generate a Book model (and associated migration), a Books controller (which inherits from CRUDController), and some sample views.

This generator assumes the use Rails 1.2+, so don't forget to put something like:

  map.resources :books

in your routes.rb.

Requirements
============

  * Rails 1.2+
  * SimplyHelpful plugin (http://dev.rubyonrails.com/svn/rails/plugins/simply_helpful)
  * AuthenticatedSystem from acts_as_authenticated or restful_authentication
